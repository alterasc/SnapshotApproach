# Snap Shot Approach mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

In the same vein as Point Blank Shot forcing character to move to 30 feet range before attacking, this mod adds additional settings to force character into Snap Shot range when PBS is enabled.
Ranges are customizable for each snap shot feat.

Examples for clarity:
Point Blank Shot is disabled: character uses ranged weapon range
Point Blank Shot is enabled, no Snap Shot feats: character is forced into 30 feet range (or weapon range if it's less)
Point Blank Shot is enabled and character has Snap Shot: character is forced into Snap Shot approach range (default 5 feet, customizable between 0 and 30)

Also has optional fix to always have base Snap Shot threat range be 5 feet instead of being affected by character size changes. Enabled by default
